WHAT IS OTTER.NVIM?                                *otter-what-is-otter.nvim?*

**tldr: Otter.nvim provides lsp features and a code completion source for code
embedded in other documents**

When implementing autocompletion, code diagnostics and the likes for
quarto-nvim <https://quarto-dev/quarto-nvim> I realized that a core feature
would be useful to other plugins and usecases as well. quarto
<https://quarto.org> documents are computational notebooks for scientific
communication based on pandoc <https://pandoc.org/>s markdown. One key feature
is that these `qmd` documents can contain exectuable code blocks, with possibly
different languages such as `R` and `python` mixed in one document.

How do we get all the cool language features we get for a pure e.g. `python`
file – like code completion, documentation hover windows, diagnostics –
when the code is just embedded as code blocks in a document? Well, if one
document can’t give us the answer, we ask an otter (another)! `otter.nvim`
creates and synchronizes hidden buffers containing a single language each and
directs requests for completion and lsp requests from the main buffer to those
other buffers (otter buffers).

Example in a markdown (or quarto markdown) document `index.md`:

>
    # Some markdown
    
    Hello world
    
    ```python
    import numpy as np
    np.zeros(10)
    ```
<


We create a hidden buffer for a file `index.md.tmp.py`

>
     
     
     
     
      import numpy as np
      np.zeros(10)
<


This contains just the python code and blank lines for all other lines (this
keeps line numbers the same, which comes straight from the trick that the
quarto dev team uses for the vs code extension as well). Language servers can
then attach to this hidden buffer. We can do this for all embedded languages
found in a document.

A GROUP OF OTTERS IS CALLED A RAFT ~

Each otter-activated buffer can maintain a set of other buffers synchronized to
the main buffer.


  In other words, each buffer can have a raft of otters!


`otter.nvim` contains a completion source for nvim-cmp
<https://github.com/hrsh7th/cmp-nvim-lua>. When a completion request is made,
the whole raft of otters is synchronized and the question is directed to the
otters. The accumulated answers are then displayed in the main buffer.

HOW DO I USE OTTER.NVIM?                      *otter-how-do-i-use-otter.nvim?*

The easiest way to get started is try it out in quarto-nvim
<https://quarto-dev/quarto-nvim> or look at the usecases there. If you want to
integrate `otter.nvim` in your own plugin or nvim config, check out the
documentation at `:h otter` in nvim or this `README.md` file.

If you call `require'otter'.dev_setup()` in your nvim configuration you will
even see code completion and documentation windows for the lua chunks in this
readme!

`otter.nvim` provides these user-facing functions:

>
    otter = require'otter'
    otter.activate_otters(languages, completion)
    otter.sync_raft(main_nr)
    otter.send_request(main_nr, request, filter)
